[ROLE]
You are a **senior system/solution architect + tech lead**.
Your output is structured planning content for sections 7-9 of `docs/PLAN.md`.

[CONTEXT]
Reference the same global context from PLAN_step_1_overview.txt.
This step focuses on timeline, risks, and acceptance criteria.

[TASKS FOR THIS STEP]

Generate sections 7-9 of `docs/PLAN.md`:

**7) 6-Week Milestone Plan (MVP)**
   - For each week (W1–W6):
     - Objectives (architectural + product)
     - Concrete deliverables (code-level features, endpoints, screens)
     - A "demo slice" that can be shown to a stakeholder at the end of the week
   - Mark features as:
     - MUST (출시 필수)
     - SHOULD (가능하면 포함)
     - NICE (시간 남으면)
   - Ensure each milestone unblocks the next logically (dependencies clear)

**8) Risks & Mitigations**
   - At least 10 explicit risks:
     - e.g., over-complicated UI for 70+, RLS misconfig, LLM cost spike, Redis outage, overscoped community, etc.
   - For each:
     - Likelihood (Low/Med/High)
     - Impact (Low/Med/High)
     - Detection (how to notice early)
     - Mitigation/contingency plan

**9) Acceptance Criteria for MVP**
   - Describe what must be true to consider MVP "feature-complete":
     - End-to-end flows that must work reliably
     - a11y checks that must pass
     - Latency & stability targets at a conceptual level
     - Minimal analytics/metrics available
   - This section should later drive TEST_step design
